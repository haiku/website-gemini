the last parts and completed phase 1 of Haikuware's bluetooth bounty:

As such, he was transferred the bounty's pool of $1820.47 (he also received some RAM for his hardware donated by haikuware admin thenerd). The bounty fell a little short of the $1950 he requested, but all in all I think he'll be happy with that sum.

I'd like to thank all the bounty contributors that made this possible, as well as Oliver for the hard work he put in to give Haiku the code for a functional bluetooth base! Congrats all around.
