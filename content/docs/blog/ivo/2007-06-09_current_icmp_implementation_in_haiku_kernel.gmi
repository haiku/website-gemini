# Current ICMP implementation in HAIKU kernel

Hi all,

According to current Haiku source ICMP implementation is only a ... framework. Only ICMP echo request messages are processed.

There are essentially two RFCs that should be considered when implementing ICMP (for IPv4). RFC792 - 'INTERNET CONTROL MESSAGE PROTCOL' and RFC1122 - 'Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers'.

According to RFC1122, paragraph 3.2.2. there are two types of ICMP messages a host must process: 1) ICMP Error Messages - Destination Unreachable - Redirect - Source Quench - Time Exceeded - Parameter Problem 2) ICMP query messages:

- Echo
- Information
- Timestamp
- Address Mask

First of all, I plan to implement a generic icmp_send_data() that should be used whenever sending ICMP messages. Then implement processing of received ICMP packets accordingly.

Offtopic: please add a NOTE to the documentation that cross compiling Haiku on x86_64 linux host is not yet possible ;)
