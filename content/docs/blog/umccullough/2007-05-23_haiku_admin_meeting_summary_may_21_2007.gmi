<p><b>Haiku Admin Meeting 2007-05-21:</b> <ul> <li>Admins discussed OpenBFS Team broadening - it has currently been renamed to <a href="/about/teams/file_systems">File System Team</a> and should probably include all file system-related aspects of Haiku.</li> <li>There was some further discussion about other OSS projects and their similar struggles with "Openness" - <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/21/156213">Mozilla's recent scrutiny</a> was cited as an example.</li> <li>There was a request for any final comments on the list of non-dev/non-admin tasks posted on the Admin mailing list.</li> <li>It was discussed that the Admin mailing list needs to be relocated - and preferably self-hosted on the Haiku-os.org server.</li> <li>It was mentioned that once the current T-shirt supply is exhausted, they will be looking for a new store/shop to create the next round of T-shirts (and possibly other merchandise). The hunt is on for high-quality shops cheaper than Cafepress - with the company that Mozilla currently uses as a possible prospect.</li> <li>The Admins discussed adopting a new method for managing meeting agendas in the future.</li> </ul> <b>That wraps it up for the May 21, 2007 meeting.</b> <br><em>I would like to remind readers that any official discussion about the decisions made by the Haiku Admins should be directed to the <a href="/community/ml#haiku">General Mailing List</a>. Any mistakes in this summary may be posted in the comments if desired or you may use my <a href="/user/12/contact">contact page</a>.</em>
