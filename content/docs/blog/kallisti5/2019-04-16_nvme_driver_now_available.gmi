**What is NVMe?** For those not keeping up with the latest advances in tech, NVMe is a M.2 form-factor flash-based storage device which attaches directly to the system's PCI Express bus. These flash devices are present in modern desktops and laptops and offer transfer speeds of **several GiB/s**.

These devices now show up in /dev/disk/nvme/ and are fully useable by Haiku.

I've personally tested[1] my Samsung 950 Pro and seen raw read speeds up to 1.4GiB/s.

Give our NVMe driver a test and let us know your own results!

(Standard disclaimer that while we haven't seen any dataloss, this is a brand **new** driver, and write support especially has not been tested extensively. *Always have backups.*)
