# Repository Update

A small notification that we have updated our repository URL's in preperation for R1 Beta 1.

This change will ensure that repository links remain consistant through R1 Beta 1 and beyond.

## nightly / master

- ```pkgman drop Haiku; pkgman drop HaikuPorts;```
- ```pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haiku/master/$(getarch)/current```
- ```pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haikuports/master/$(getarch)/current```

## r1beta1

- ```pkgman drop Haiku; pkgman drop HaikuPorts;```
- ```pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haiku/r1beta1/$(getarch)/current```
- ```pkgman add https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haikuports/master/$(getarch)/current```

The "meta url" used for repository identification changed as as well, so running through these steps at least once on historic installs will ensure continued functionality.
