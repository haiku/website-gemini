# Midterm Results: All students passed!

Over the weekend, Google processed the results for the midterm evaluations for Google Summer of Code 2012. I'm pleased to announce that all five students passed their midterm evaluations! As you may have seen, the students have been <a href="/tags/gsoc2012">posting details on their progress and future plans</a> on their blogs. Last month, two students even gained commit access.  <a href="https://www.freelists.org/post/haiku-development/Commit-access-for-Alex-Smith">Alex Smith</a> received it for Haiku's repository and <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/haiku-port-dev/2012-June/000087.html">Hamish Morrison</a> received access to OpenJDK. Congratulations everyone and keep up the great work!
