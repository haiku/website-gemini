# Update 2: Contracts for Package Management 

An unexpected change has necessitated a delay to the start of the <a href="/news/2012-08-20_two_contractors_each_two_months">package management contracts</a>. Ingo recently <a href="https://www.freelists.org/post/haiku-inc/Contract-Proposal-Package-Management,23">posted the update</a> to the [haiku-inc] mailing list. To sum it up, the parts he is responsible for need to be updated to match changes by the customer. At this time, the delay could be anywhere from a few days of work or could be several weeks. The current plan is for Ingo and Oliver to start at the same time. While that asks for patience among us, having both working in tandem is expected to have a synergistic effect. As more information becomes available, I'll try to keep everyone up to date.
