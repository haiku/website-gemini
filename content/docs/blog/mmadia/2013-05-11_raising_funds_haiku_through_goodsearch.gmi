# Raising funds for Haiku through Goodsearch

<a href="http://www.goodsearch.com/?charityid=949749"><img src="/files/images/goodsearch_200x40.jpg" alt="GoodSearch logo" border="8" align="right" /></a> Last month on the [haiku-inc] mailing list, Arman "Kulluminatii" Chahal suggested adding Haiku to <a href="http://www.goodsearch.com">Goodsearch</a>. "What is Goodsearch?", you may ask. It's a Yahoo! powered search engine that will donate money (about a penny) to your favorite non-profit or school. They provide <a href="http://www.goodsearch.com/about">other ways to help earn money</a> -- shopping online, participating in online surveys, completing special offers and more! This past week, the registration process completed and Haiku is now a <a href="http://www.goodsearch.com/nonprofit/haiku.aspx">participating non profit</a>!

To choose Haiku as your cause, <ol>  <li>Go to <a href="http://www.goodsearch.com/">goodsearch's homepage</a></li>  <li>Click the "Choose a cause" button</li>  <li>Enter "Haiku" in the search box.</li>  <li>Select "Haiku (Saddle Brook, NJ)"</li> </ol>

<strong>Alternatively, you can simply bookmark <a href="http://www.goodsearch.com/?charityid=949749">http://www.goodsearch.com/?charityid=949749</a></strong>

Currently, WebPositive is hard-coded to use Google when performing a search query from the URL bar. Until a user-defined setting is implemented, the easiest way is simply to set goodsearch as the start page, navigate to it and perform your search.

To set WebPositive's homepage, <ol>  <li>Go to Window and select Settings</li>  <li>Paste http://www.goodsearch.com/?charityid=949749 as the Start page and click Apply.</li> </ol>

Overall, this is another way each of us can collectively chip in and help raise secure additional funding for HAIKU. Thank you for the suggestion, Kulluminatii!
