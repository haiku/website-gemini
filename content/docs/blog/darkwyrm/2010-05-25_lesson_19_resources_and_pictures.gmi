# Lesson 19: Resources and Pictures

Ten years ago when I first started to learn to write code using BeOS, I had a lot of questions that I couldn't any documentation to give me the answers. Luckily, there was the Be Code Talk mailing list and kindhearted members of the community, like David Sowsy (Animaxo, Vesa Accepted). Resources are one of those things that eluded me. Eventually I figured them out, but Lesson 19 lays some of it out in plain conversation.
