# Lesson 18: Application Scripting

After a _long_ hiatus, Lesson #18 is available for your reading pleasure. The topic? Scripting Haiku applications, possibly one of the least understood aspects of the operating system. Learn about hey command, its uses, and even see some of the most English-like bash commands ever. Also see how to make almost any Haiku application answer your beck and call and tinker around the operating system with an updated version of the <em>ScriptWorld</em> demo application, <em>Scripting Explorer</em>.
