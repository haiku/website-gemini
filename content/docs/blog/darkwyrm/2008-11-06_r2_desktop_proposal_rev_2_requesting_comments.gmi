I just finished (finally) consolidating the two R2-related RFCs that I've written and revising them, and I'd appreciate comments, criticism, etc. You can get it from <a href="http://darkwyrm.beemulated.net/haiku/R2_Desktop_Refined.pdf">this link</a>. If you have an opinion on what Haiku should look like, I'd genuinely appreciate your input. :)
