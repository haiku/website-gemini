# Lucky Lesson 13: Queries

I'm not talking about databases, either. In this lesson, we examine one of the most distinctive features Haiku has: the query. We get a good, long look into the murky depths that are the query's official syntax, Reverse Polish Notation, and a few other weird and wonderful tricks. Enjoy!
