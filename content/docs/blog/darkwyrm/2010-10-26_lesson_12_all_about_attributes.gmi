# Lesson 12: All About Attributes

You might think that I took a short vacation, but I've just been buried in Real Life. You might also be wondering about where lessons 6-11 went. They'll be published later, but you're not missing anything, as they are edits of the last several lessons from Learning to Program with Haiku with an experienced developer in mind. If you've worked with the previous series, there isn't anything in 6-11 that you haven't seen before -- they're more to make the Programming with Haiku series complete on its own. This lesson is all about attributes -- what they are, how they can be useful, and how they are manipulated from code.
