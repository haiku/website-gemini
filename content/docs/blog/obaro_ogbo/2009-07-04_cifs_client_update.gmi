# CIFS client update

The journey so far.

I have implemented basic file system interface functionality including mount and unmount, and can load it directly as a kernel addon and via userlandfs. At present the client expects just the server ip address and the share name in the format :. I have begun implementing protocol negotiation, and hope to complete the setup of a session using LANMAN in the next few days. I had hoped to have begun implementing file actions by now but unfortunately I'm quite a way from that.

Back to coding
