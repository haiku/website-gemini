Friday, I sleep surprisingly well for a first night abroad. I chose to wear a red FSFE t-shirt "<a href="https://fsfe.org/order/">There is NO CLOUD, just some other people's computers</a>".

Ringing the bell didn't really work the first time, so I had to work a bit and retry once or twice. But then I was greeted by a French guy, who gave me a tour of the space : <a href="http://library.noisebridge.net/">library</a>, soldering stations, lots of <a href="https://parts.noisebridge.net/">parts</a>, two classroom, a sewing space, and soon a large cutting machine… they have the whole 3rd floor of the building! <img align="right" width="25%" height="25%" src="/files/DSCN4567.JPG" /> There weren't many occupants as most hackers were at the <a href="http://toorcamp.toorcon.net/">Toorcamp</a> for the week. But gradually more people came in, either hackers with their own RFID pass, or visitors ringing the bell. After some time, we noticed there were more French-speaking people than natives :D

I plugged my laptop, found the (open) Wifi, and started writing a few slides for the GCI lightning talk on Monday. After some distractions (curse twitter!), I managed to produce 5 slides, which should be enough.

There already was some code to send videos to it, but I decided to add a vout module right into VLC. And… it works! Just need to upstream the patch now.
