# Haiku mentionned at the European Parliament

Before writing a full RMLL 2013 report on the way home, I just wanted to say that I mentionned Haiku in a question about hardware specifications at the European Parliament on tuesday during a JURI commission workshop : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ep-live/fr/committees/video?event=20130709-1530-COMMITTEE-JURI (it's at the end, 2nd question after the 2nd panel)

We're getting famous ;-)
