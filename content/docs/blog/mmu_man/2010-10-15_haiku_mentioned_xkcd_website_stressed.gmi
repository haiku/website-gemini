This morning I was welcome by a nice <a href="http://xkcd.com/806/">XKCD cartoon</a> mentioning Haiku (as an experimental OS).

Several of us started twitting (rather, <a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a>-ing) about it, proud as we were.

Then when getting back tonight we noticed the website was unreachable.

It really seems like it brought us quite a lot of unwaranted advertising! It's quite visible on the server stats: <img src="http://revolf.free.fr/beos/stats-haiku-www-20101015.png">

Here is a screengrab of the twitter search for <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/haiku%20xkcd">"haiku xkcd"</a>: <a href="http://revolf.free.fr/beos/xkcd-haiku-20101015.png"><img src="http://revolf.free.fr/beos/xkcd-haiku-20101015-th.png"></a>

The server load really synchronizes well with the twitter search...

Or it might be due to our GSoC wrap-up report <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/10/another-successful-summer-for-haiku.html">mentioned on Google blog</a> :-)
