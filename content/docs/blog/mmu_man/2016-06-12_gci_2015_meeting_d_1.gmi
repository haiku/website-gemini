Saturday, also slept very well, I'm thinking about taking the mattress with me but it won't fit into the plane. and yet I woke up early to participate in a French radio show remotely, that is broadcasted live from the <a href="http://vip2016.popsyteam.org/">Very Important Party</a> (a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoparty">DemoParty</a> I usually attend), for them it's 5pm, but for me it's 8amâ€¦

At 10 I'm packing up as I'll have to change the hotel, I just hope I'll sleep as well in the next one. It's much more expensive but that doesn't always scale linearly with the sleep levels!

Finally, someone lets me in, and I find myself in the middle of people setting up for a concert. I actually noticed the "Noise Pancakes" event on their schedule already. I find a seat, pull my laptop, and start running VLC with the microphone as audio input, and the visualization effects sent to the Flaschen-Taschen (they have two, one is 20 by 25 pix, er, bottles, the other is 40 by 45). I also added some funny pictures and messages to the playlist, and played with it throughout the two hours of the event. It was mostly some strange music, although interesting. I did use earplugs though. The pancakes were excellent, btw.

At 2pm we were back to a few, we moved the tables back in place, and started hacking. Some others joined till the evening. I helped my table neighbor apply my VLC patch for the Flaschen-Taschen, and he had a lot of fun with it.  <img align="left" height="25%" width="25%" src="/files/small_DSCN4673.JPG" />Then it was time to check-in at the other hotel, and oh, they were out of king-size beds, but I couldn't care less. Really, this room is the size of my entire flat! Who needs that much space to sleep anyway!?

Ok, let's see if the bed is as nice as it looks!
