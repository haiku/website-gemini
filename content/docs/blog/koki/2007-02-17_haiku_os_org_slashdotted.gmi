This morning we were discussing by email with Waldemar what could be causing some DB errors from the photo gallery and a general slowness of the website. Waldemar contacted our service provider, and their response was "your site has suddenly become too popular" (something that effect). Well, no wonder: I just noticed that we were Slashdotted (<a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/02/17/1550218&threshold=-1">Haiku Tech Talk at Google a Success</a>). I checked the logs, and it looks like the site received about 10,000 hits from /. in less than 12 hours!

This was the first article about Haiku in Slashdot.org since June 29, 2005 (<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/29/213240">WalterCon 2005</a>). I have the feeling that we will be mentioned more often from now on. On a somewhat related note, a search for "haiku" on del.icio.us ranks our website in second place, while on Google, we are consistently on fourth position. Not bad at all. :-)
