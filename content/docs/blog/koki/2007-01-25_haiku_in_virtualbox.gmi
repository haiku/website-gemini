# Haiku in VirtualBox

Today I woke up to the news that Haiku was mentioned at <a href="http://journal.mycom.co.jp/column/osx/211/">MYCOM Journal</a>, a Japanese IT related news site, in a regular column known as <strong>OSX Hacking</strong>. This time the author was playing with <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> and he tried running Haiku on it. Well, he did succeed, but the speed was not up to the expectations. <a href="http://journal.mycom.co.jp/photo/column/osx/211/images/003l.jpg">GLTeaPot ran at the incredible speed of 1.3FPS</a> (yes, you read right!), on a first generation MacBook 1.83GHz. Here is <a href="http://journal.mycom.co.jp/photo/column/osx/211/images/002l.jpg">another screenshot</a> of the entire Haiku desktop running in VirtualBox.

I should note that the author does conclude that VirtualBox still has a long way to go when compared to VMWare and Parallels (both of which run Haiku pretty snappy, btw). Anyway, nice to see an instance of Haiku making it into the mainstream media in Japan.

Thanks to Kakeru-san for the heads up. ;-)
