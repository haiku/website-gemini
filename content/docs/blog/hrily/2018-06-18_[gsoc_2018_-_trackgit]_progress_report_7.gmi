# [GSoC 2018 - TrackGit] Progress Report 7

This is the seventh progress report for TrackGit project. I did the following in last week.

## Merge Request on Haiku

At the start of the project, I had made a merge request on Haiku regarding Dynamic Add on menu. There were few comments on it which I forgot to check. I addressed those comments. Link[1] to the merge request.

## Implemented Add files command

I implemented the Add files command. This option adds the selected files to the git repository. Link[1] to the commmit.

## Implemented Add All files

This option is shown when no files are selected. This option adds all the changed files to the git repository. It is equivalent of `git add --all`. It is handy sometimes. Link[1] to commit.
