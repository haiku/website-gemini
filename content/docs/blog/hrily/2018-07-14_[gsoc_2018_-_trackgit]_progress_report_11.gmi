# [GSoC 2018 - TrackGit] Progress Report 11

This is the eleventh progress report for TrackGit project. I did the following in last week:

## Implemented Create Branch command

I implemented Create Branch command. This command creates a branch at head of the repository. There is also an option to switch to the newly created branch. Link[1] to commit.
