# [GSoC 2018 - TrackGit] Progress Report 8

This is the eighth progress report for TrackGit project. I did the following in last week.

## Implemented Commit command

I implemented the equivalent of `git commit` in TrackGit. The implementation was a little bit trickier because libgit2 used a different logic when the commit is first or non-first. The link[1] to commit.

## Added test for commit command

I also added the test case for commit command. This simply makes a commit and checks if the commit is made via status command.
