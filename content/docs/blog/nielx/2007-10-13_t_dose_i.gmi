# T-DOSE (I)

I just arrived at the event location. My first impression: a highly geek audience. So I might have to change the tone of my speech. The venue is okay, and The rooms are enormous. I have no idea how many people are going to be present when I speak tomorrow morning. The time is 11 am by the way, gmt   1, and there is a webcast. Check www.t-dose.org. I'm now going to see some talks, to see what kind of audience I might expect.
