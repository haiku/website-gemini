# Some bluetooth documentation

Hello Haiku world,

Given my lack of updates lately I have decided to give some official update on my work here, and at last leave some overview documentation so any newcomer could have an easier startup.

<ul>  <li><a href="http://urnenfeld.blogspot.com.es/2012/07/in-past-i-got-to-know-that-motivation.html"> Documentation</a></li> </ul>

Note that <strong>I have been and I will be: around, open reply questions and offer all support I can</strong> this is not a farewell!

Thank you all for this period of life.
