# Layout docs landing

It's been a long time coming, and they're still not done, but I've committed some initial documentation for the Layout API. For the curious, you can access the documented classes <a href="https://api.haiku-os.org/group__interface.html">here</a>, there is also an introduction to building a GUI with the Layout API <a href="https://api.haiku-os.org/layout_intro.html">here</a>. If you happen to find a typo, or inaccurate info, please contact me so I can fix it. Finally, note that, like the documentation, the Layout API is <b>not yet finalized</b>.
