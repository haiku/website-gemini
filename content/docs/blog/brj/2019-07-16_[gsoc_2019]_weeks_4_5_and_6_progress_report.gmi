Hello everybody! It's been a while since my previous post[1].

This post is a short summary of all work done upto this point.

During the past few weeks, I was able to add the following features to the current btrfs implementation

## Creating new files The basic algorithm behind creating new files is allocating a new inode, updating the fs tree to reflect this, creating a hard link in the directory containing the file and finally updating the cache. However, we must make sure to deallocate memory and clean up any partial changes in case of any errors.

## Unlinking files In order to unlink files, we have to remove their inodes and delete their hardlinks.

## Writing filesystem information Much of filesystem wide information such as number of blocks, filesystem size, various flags, filesystem name (a.k.a label) etc is stored in the superblock.

This feature is used to update this information.

## Current and future work Currently, I am working on add node splitting and node merging to the BTree implementation used by btrfs in order to make sure that overflow and underflow of keys in a node does not happen.

By the end of 2nd month, I aim to add some more features to btrfs including, but not limited to, renaming files, checksumming superblock (this has been left as TODO in many places), adding touch command to btrfs_shell (I started working on this but stopped abruptly to work on something else), writing file info etc.

On a side note, I stopped writing a daily report as it was unproductive.
