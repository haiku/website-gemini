# How to Help with the OpenJDK Port

I've gotten several (at least five or six) emails from people contacting me through this website. It seems to be a common question.

I'd like to publicly apologize to any that I have not responded to personally. To those of you, I'm sorry.

So here, publicly posted, is how to get started in helping out with the OpenJDK port.

<ol> <li>Read http://openjdk.java.net/contribute/     You'll need to sign an SCA and do what it says regarding the licensing.</li> <li>Subscribe to the mailing list for the Haiku Port project at OpenJDK.

```
http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/haiku-port-dev</li>
```
<li>Once you've subscribed, send an email to the list.

```
Include your name, interests, skills, and ask what you could do to start right now.</li>
```

</ol>

There's been quite a bit of progress from Andrew this last week. He's updated MakeDeps, and he's fiddled with some code from the old beunited.org 1.4.2 port and <b>has it running on Haiku.</b> Great work, Andrew!

The march to bootstrapping an OpenJDK build is underway.
