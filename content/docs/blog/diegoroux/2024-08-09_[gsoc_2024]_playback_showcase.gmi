# intro Hello, once again!

# vid? We made it! I previously stated that we had achieved playback, but I never got to show it. So here it is, a short video  showing you that playback actually works.

So you don't have to go and compile it, just to see it on  action.

# outro Main functionality is here! So, I believe that it may be time to maybe push into the main branch.

You can see all my progress at my fork[1], within the branch `virtio-sound-dev`.

Until next time.
