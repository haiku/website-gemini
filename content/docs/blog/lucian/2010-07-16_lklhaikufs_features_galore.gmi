# lklhaikufs: features galore

The LKL-based Haiku driver has progressed well in the last few weeks.

The set of features already implemented: <ul> <li>mounting and unmounting ext3, ext4 disk images*, both read-only and <b>read-write</b></li> <li>listing file system attributes (read-only/read-write, file system size, number of files created, number of files remaining to be created, etc.) </li> <li>browsing the contents of any folder on the file system</li> <li>listing file permissions, owner, group, type (directory, symlink, regular file, etc.)</li> <li>opening/closing existing files, and <b>creating</b> new files</li> <li>reading and <b>writing</b> data into files</li> <li>creating new directories</li> </ul>

What still needs to be done: <ul> <li>renaming files</li> <li>deleting files and directories</li> </ul>

- I only tested ext3 and ext4, other should work as well. There's a limitation in the ext4 support in LKL, not related to this driver in particular that needs to be fixed.
