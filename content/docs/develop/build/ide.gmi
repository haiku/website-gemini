# Using an IDE
## Live Code Analysis
While developing the Haiku codebase, it is possible to generate an inventory of compile commands by passing the **-c** flag to jam. The resulting **compile_commands.json** document will assist tools such as 
=> http://clangd.llvm.org clangd
 in live analyzing our source code.

Generating the **compile_commands.json** for clangd:
```
$ mkdir generated.clangd && cd generated.clangd
$ configure --build-cross-tools x86_64 --cross-tools-source ../../buildtools
$ jam -anc @nightly-anyboot
$ ln -sr compile_commands.json ../compile_commands.json
```

When you use an editor which supports 
=> http://clangd.llvm.org clangd
 such as 
=> http://helix-editor.com helix
 or 
=> http://vim.org vim
 (with the clangd plugin), 
=> http://clangd.llvm.org clangd
 will have knowledge of the relevant include paths and build flags for every source file within the Haiku codebase.

Tip: When new source code files are added, you will need to run though the process above for a complete database.
