# Disk driver ioctls
Here is a list of ioctls usually implemented by disk devices.

## B_GET_DEVICE_SIZE
The parameter is a size_t and is filled with the disk size in bytes. This is limited to 4GB and not very useful. B_GET_GEOMETRY is used instead.

## B_GET_GEOMETRY
The parameter is a device_geometry structure to be filled with the device geometry.

## B_GET_ICON_NAME
Deprecated. Get the name of an icon to use. The icons are hardcoded in Tracker.

## B_GET_VECTOR_ICON
The parameter is a device_icon structure to be populated with the icon data in HVIF format. This icon is then used to show the disk in Tracker, for example.

## B_EJECT_DEVICE
Eject the device (for removable devices).

## B_LOAD_MEDIA
Load the device (reverse of eject) if possible.

## B_FLUSH_DRIVE_CACHE
Make sure all data is stored on persistent storage and not in caches (including any caching inside the device)

## B_TRIM_DEVICE
The parameter is an fs_trim_data structure. It is guaranteed to be in kernel memory because the partition manager pre-processes requests coming from userland and makes sure no sectors are outside the partition range for a specific partition device.

Mark the listed areas on disk as unused, allowing future reads to these areas to return random data or read errors. Flash memory devices (SSD, MMC, â€¦) may use this information to optimize their internal storage.
