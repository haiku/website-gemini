# Input Processing
## Input Server messages
The Input Server collects information about keyboard and mouse events and forwards them to the app_server via messages. They are sent to port specifically for such messages, and the port is monitored by a thread whose task is to monitor, process, and dispatch them to the appropriate recipients. The Input Server is a regular BApplication, and unlike other applications, it requests a port to which it can send input messages.

## Mouse
Mouse events consist of button changes, mouse movements, and the mouse wheel. The message will consist of the time of the event and attachments appropriate for each message listed below:

### B_MOUSE_DOWN
* when

* buttons’ status

* location of the cursor

* modifiers

* clicks

### B_MOUSE_UP
* time

* buttons’ status

* location of the cursor

* modifiers

### B_MOUSE_MOVED
* time

* location of the cursor

* buttons’ status

### B_MOUSE_WHEEL_CHANGED
* time

* location of the cursor

* transit - in or out

* x delta

* y delta

## Keyboard
Keyboard events consist of notification when a key is pressed or released. Any keypress or release will evoke a message, regardless of whether or not the key is mapped. The message will consist of the appropriate code and attachments listed below:

### B_KEY_DOWN
* time

* key code

* repeat count

* modifiers

* states

* UTF-8 code

* string generated

* modifier-independent ASCII code

### B_KEY_UP
* time

* key code

* modifiers

* states

* UTF-8 code

* string generated

* modifier-independent ASCII code

### B_UNMAPPED_KEY_DOWN
* time

* key code

* modifiers

* states

### B_UNMAPPED_KEY_UP
* time

* key code

* modifiers

* states

### B_MODIFIERS_CHANGED
sent when a modifier key changes

* time

* modifier states

* previous modifier states

* states

Nearly all keypresses received by the app_server are passed onto the appropriate application. Control-Tab, when held, is sent to the Deskbar for app switching. Command+F?? is intercepted and a workspace is switched. Left Control + Alt + Delete is not even intercepted by the app_server. The Input Server receives it and shows the Team Monitor window.
