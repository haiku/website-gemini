These are the TODO items for the Haiku **Package Management**.

# packagefs
* If necessary, add a caching mechanism to speed up mounting it.

# Package Daemon
* Complete support for extracting and updating settings files: Merge support and user feedback are still missing.

* Add user notification/interaction support for initial verification (on start-up).

* Support packages being copied to the "packages" directory. Currently only moving works.

# Package building
* Define packaging guidelines and create a tool to check packages against those.

* Status: Here’s the 
=> PackagingPolicy.rst wiki page
 defining the policy. It’s still a work in progress. haikuporter has some policy checking built in already.

# Package kit/manager
* Add system update support.

* Status: Mostly functional in pkgman ("pkgman full-sync"), but unsupported in HaikuDepot.

# Boot loader
* Safe mode/recovery options:

* Disable packages installed in home.

# Package/package repository format
* Add localization support.

=> http://www.freelists.org/post/haiku-depot-web/Title-localization,29 info
.

* Add support for repository keys (public/private) and package signing/checksums, so that it is possible to verify that data retrieved from a repository have not been tampered with.

* Add package sizes to repository. Since there are plans to support xz (or other high-ratio formats) compressed uncompressed packages for download that are recompressed for installation, we probably need to discriminate between download and installation sizes.

* Add support for a faster compression format (e.g. 
=> https://lz4.github.io/lz4/ lz4
). As it turns out, the currently used zlib compression is rather slow (slower than reading uncompressed data from a slow HD).

* Add MIME info for types supported by packaged applications (and sniffer rules?) to the package attributes.

# Miscellaneous
* Add MIME directory watching to registrar, so it can update the MIME DB caches when packages are de-/activated.

* Get rid of post_install scripts. Do that in the build system.

* Get rid of UserBootscript. Start the scripts in “~/config/settings/boot/launch” from Bootscript instead.

* Update Installer.
