# The m68k port
The Motorola 68000 is an old CPU and not a reasonable target for Haiku. However, later models which are equipped with a memory management unit could work (slowly).

There is work in progress to target Atari, Amiga, and NeXT hardware platforms.

## Todo list
* optimization: remove M68KPagingStructures[*]::UpdateAllPageDirs() and just allocate all the kernel page root entries at boot and be done with it. Itâ€™s not very big anyway.

* possibly other optimizations in the VM code due to not supporting SMP?

## Target platforms information
